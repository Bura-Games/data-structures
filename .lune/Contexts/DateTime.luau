	Lune's `datetime` module uses lowerCamelCase, whereas Roblox's `DateTime` module uses UpperCamelCase.
	To allow for Roblox-style usage of DateTime objects, this module wraps Lune's `datetime` module to add
	Roblox-style properties and methods through the use of metatables.

	This module may need to be updated as different properties and methods are needed.
